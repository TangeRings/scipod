const PROMPT_TEMPLATE = `You are an expert podcast planner assisting scientists in outlining podcasts based on uploaded papers and specific instructions. Your task is to generate three variants of podcast formats using the provided paper content.

First, carefully read and analyze the following paper content:

<paper_content>
{{PAPER_CONTENT}}
</paper_content>

Using the paper content, generate outlines for three podcast format variants:

1. üîç Investigative Deep Dive
2. üß† Hypothesis vs. Reality (Socratic)  
3. üß¨ The Scientist's Story (Biographical)

For each format, create an outline that includes:
a) A compelling title
b) 3-5 main segments or topics
c) Key questions to be addressed
d) Potential guests or expert commentators
e) Unique elements that fit the specific format

IMPORTANT: Return your response as a valid JSON object with this exact structure:

{
  "podcast_formats": [
    {
      "id": "investigative_deep_dive",
      "title": "Compelling title here",
      "description": "Brief description of this format",
      "segments": ["Segment 1", "Segment 2", "Segment 3"],
      "key_questions": ["Question 1?", "Question 2?", "Question 3?"],
      "potential_guests": ["Guest 1", "Guest 2"],
      "unique_elements": ["Element 1", "Element 2"]

      "potential_guests": ["Guest 1", "Guest 2"],
      "unique_elements": ["Element 1", "Element 2"]
    }
  ]
}

Remember to tailor each format to the unique aspects of the research and ensure they remain engaging and accessible to a general audience.`;

    Research Paper: "Machine Learning Applications in Climate Prediction"
    
    Abstract: This study explores the use of advanced machine learning algorithms to improve long-term climate prediction models. We developed a novel neural network architecture that incorporates satellite data, ocean temperature measurements, and atmospheric composition data to predict climate patterns with 23% higher accuracy than traditional models.
    
    Introduction: Climate prediction has long been a challenge for scientists due to the complex interactions between atmospheric, oceanic, and terrestrial systems. Traditional models rely heavily on physics-based equations, but recent advances in machine learning offer new opportunities for improvement.
    
    Methodology: We collected data from 500+ weather stations globally over a 20-year period, combined with satellite imagery and ocean buoy measurements. Our deep learning model was trained on this comprehensive dataset using a transformer architecture specifically designed for time-series climate data.
    
    Results: The model achieved 78% accuracy in predicting temperature variations 6 months in advance, compared to 55% for traditional models. Precipitation predictions showed a 67% accuracy rate. The model was particularly effective at predicting extreme weather events.
    
    Conclusion: Machine learning represents a significant advancement in climate science, offering more accurate predictions that could help communities better prepare for climate change impacts.
