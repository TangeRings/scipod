I want to build an app with multiple pages, where the scienent/author can upload their papers and their background story and ultimately llm can convert that into an engaging podcast script and then mp3 file. the prototype follows a linear process. So i will start working on the first landing page. in my mind, the first page is simple slick where the author can upload a story (possible a text file), and upload multiple pdf files of their academic papers. so bascially two input spaces. and then in the second page, aftter AI analyis, it displays 3 suggested podcast structure/stype and 5 sample questions in the interview for the author to review/choose.
